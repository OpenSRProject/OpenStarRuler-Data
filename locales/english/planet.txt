HINT_USE_PLANETS_TITLE: Idle Planets
HINT_USE_PLANETS: <<|
	Level 0 planets cost money to maintain.
	
	Export resources from your low level planets to build up higher level ones,
	or abandon unused planets to free up your budget.
>>

HINT_COLONIZE_TITLE: Slow Colonization
HINT_COLONIZE: <<|
	Colonization requires populations and costs money. When in debt, the rate of colonization
	can be greatly slowed.
	
	Focus on colonizing a small number of planets at first and grow those planets to support further
	colonization. You may also cancel colonization orders to speed up the remaining orders.

TT_DEFENSE_TARGET: <<|
	[b]Build Defense for...[/b]

	Instead of building defense ships around the planet itself, build defense ships
	for use in another target system you control.
>>

PLANET_POPULATION_TIP: <<|
	[b]Population[/b]
	
	How many billion people live on the planet. The more population a planet has, the higher its base income and pressure capacity.
>>

PLANET_INCOME_TIP: <<
	[b]Income[/b]

	The amount of money this planet makes or loses every budget cycle.

	[b]Imported Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$1[/offset]
	[b]Active Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$2[/offset]
>>

PLANET_INFLUENCE_TIP: <<
	[b]Influence Stake[/b]
	
	Each influence stake on a planet increases your percentage of the galactic influence generation.

	Influence is used to affect other empires diplomatically.

	[b]Imported Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$1[/offset]
	[b]Active Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$2[/offset]

	[b]Active Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$2[/offset]
>>

PLANET_LOYALTY_TIP: <<|
	[b]Loyalty[/b]

	Loyalty indicates how dedicated your subjects on this planet are.

	Sieging a planet will gradually reduce its loyalty until it hits 0, after
	which it will be captured by the sieging empire.

	The more loyal a planet, the more influence it takes to annex.
>>

PLANET_PRESSURE_TIP: <<
	[b]Pressure Capacity[/b]

	Many types of planetary resources provide [b]Pressure[/b] to the planet they are on.

	[b]Pressure[/b] causes the civilians on a planet to put down buildings that generate certain types of resources for you.

	The amount of civilian structures a planet can support is limited by its [b]Pressure Capacity[/b]. If the pressure capacity is exceeded, lower efficiency civilian buildings will be constructed, leading to a loss of resource generation.

	The higher a planet's [b]Population[/b], the higher its [b]Pressure Capacity[/b].

	[b]Total Imported Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$1[/offset]
	[b]Total Active Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$2[/offset]
	[b]Pressure Capacity:[/b] [offset=220]$3[/offset]
>>

PLANET_LABOR_TIP: <<
	[b]Labor[/b]
	
	Labor affects the rate of construction at the planet.

	[b]Imported Pressure:[/b] [offset=220]$1[/offset]

PLANET_RESEARCH_TIP: <<
	[b]Research[/b]
	
	Generates research points to spend in the research grid to unlock new technologies.
